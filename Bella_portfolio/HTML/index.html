        <p>I'm pursing a BS in Business Administration with an emphasis in both Marketing and Business Analytics with a minor in Creative Technology and Design (CTD) from the college of Business and Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder.
            <br>
            <br>
            During my time at CU Boulder, I have gained skills in communication strategies, marketing startegies, an understanding of all the major business fields, programming skills in platforms such as SQL, Python, Alteryx, R-Studio, design skills, and more.
            Moreover, I have developed a passion in social media marketing and content creation. 
            This has allowed me to become efficnet with technology as I am able to problem-solve and work through multiple coding platforms.
            Additionally, I have learned a plethora of skills throughout my four years at CU, and I will continue to grow within these fields.
            <br><br>
            I'm intrested in technological advancements and I can't wait to see what opportunities arise in the future!
            <br> <br> 
              I'm originally from Northern Virginia, just outside of Washington D.C. In my free time I enjoy travel, skiing, dining at new restaurants, spending time with family and friends, contributing to my Sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, and taking the perfect sunset picture!
            These programs emphasize problem-solving, creativity, analytics, critical thinking, design, and more! </p>
